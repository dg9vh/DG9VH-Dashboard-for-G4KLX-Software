=====================================================================

Introduction:
-------------

Based upon your distribution, there are different ways to install the 
recommended webserver. This Step-by-Step-Installation-Guide is based on 
a Raspberry Pi and it's raspbian (debian based) operating system.

Installing Steps:
-----------------

1. Installing the webserver (lighttpd)
1.1 Open up a terminal session
1.2 sudo apt-get update
1.3 sudo apt-get install lighttpd
1.4 sudo apt-get install php5-common php5-cgi php5
1.5 sudo lighty-enable-mod fastcgi-php
1.6 sudo /etc/init.d/lighttpd force-reload

The following steps should be done for easier file-handling (changing 
file-permissions to make it easier to copy files and so on): 

1.7 sudo chown -R pi:pi /var/www 
1.8 chmod og+rx /var/www

2. Now it's time to get the dasboard-files:

2.1 cd /var/www
2.2 wget https://github.com/dg9vh/DG9VH-Dashboard-for-G4KLX-Software/archive/master.zip
2.3 unzip master.zip

Now serveral files should be unzipped into a folder called 
DG9VH-Dashboard-for-G4KLX-Software-master.

If you wish, you could rename the folder with following command:

2.4 mv DG9VH-Dashboard-for-G4KLX-Software-master dashboard

Following steps asume, that 1.12 is done.

2.5 cd /var/www/dashboard

3. Now we start to configure the dashboard to our own needs

3.1 nano ircddblocal.php

Now the configuration-file is opened in an editor. First of all you have 
to set your distribution of the g4klx-software. Here you got 3 preset 
configurations and one you could configure to your own wishes.

3.2 To chose one of the configuration-lines simply delete the // before the 
define-line and set two // in front of the ones you don't want.

For example: You got a DL5DI-installation, based on Debian-packages:
//define("DISTRIBUTION","MARYLAND");
//define("DISTRIBUTION","WESTERN");
define("DISTRIBUTION","DL5DI_DEBIAN");
//define("DISTRIBUTION","DL5DI_CENTOS");
//define("DISTRIBUTION","OTHER");

If you are using a Western-Dstar-Image:
//define("DISTRIBUTION","MARYLAND");
define("DISTRIBUTION","WESTERN");
//define("DISTRIBUTION","DL5DI_DEBIAN");
//define("DISTRIBUTION","DL5DI_CENTOS");
//define("DISTRIBUTION","OTHER");

Default-installation is for Maryland-Dstar because of the fact, I am 
using this image on my personal hotspot.

If you are using not a distribution above, chose "OTHER" and do some customization in the 'case "OTHER":'-part:

  case "OTHER":
// Configuration for all others, please customize
// if necessary
        define("LOGPATH", "/var/log");
        define("CONFIGPATH", "/etc");
        define("DSTARREPEATERLOGPATH", LOGPATH. "/");
        define("DSTARREPEATERLOGFILENAME", "DStarRepeater-");
        define("LINKLOGPATH", LOGPATH . "/Links.log");
        define("HRDLOGPATH", LOGPATH . "/Headers.log");
        break;
}

3.3 All other values are described within the configuration-file and could 
be modified to your own wishes.

3.4 If you are enabling the remotecontrol-Section be sure to have 
remotecontrold configured well. The remotecontrol-Application of the 
g4klx-software has to work fully functionally for using this section.

After all, your dashboard should be availiable on the hotspot like:
http://hotspot-hostname/dashboard/dashboard.php

4. Modifying webserver-configuration for easier access in webbrowser 
(shorter URL):

4.1 sudo nano /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf
4.2 server.document-root        = "/var/www/dashboard"
4.3 index-file.names            = ( "dashboard.php", "index.php", "index.html", "index.lighttpd.html" )

After this, the dashboard would be reachable under http://hotspot-hostname/

5. Modifying the dashboard itself 

You could also do some modifications on the optical presentation of the 
dashboard. If you have css-skills, feel free to modify the stylesheets 
in ircddb.css.

You can add your personal background-image as "background.jpg" into the 
"images"-folder.

You can also deactivate or move the infoboxes on the website by 
modifying the dashboard.php-file. Here you can move or comment/uncomment 
the lines below the "headline()"-line.

Use as comments those you can use in standard-php-code: // or /* ... */, 
where ... is the function-call.
